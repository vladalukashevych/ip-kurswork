        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>Cooking Recipes is here to help you cook delicious meals with less stress and more joy. We offer recipes and
            cooking advice for home cooks, by home cooks. Helping create “kitchen wins” is what we’re all about.

            Cooking Recipes was founded in 2022 by Vlada Lukashevych as a home cooking blog to record her favorite
            family recipes.
            Today, Cooking Recipes has grown into a trusted resource for home cooks with more than 10 tested recipes,
            guides, and meal plans, drawing over 1 reader each month from around the world. We’re supported by
            a diverse group of recipe developers, food writers, recipe and product testers, photographers, and other
            creative professionals.</p>

        <h1>Editorial Guidelines</h1>
        <p>At Cooking Recipes, we take great pride in the quality of our content. Our writers, photographers, and
            editors create original, accurate, and engaging content that reflects the interests and concerns of home
            cooks, and our recipe editors verify all user submissions before publication.

            Original illustrations, graphics, images, and videos are created by internal teams who collaborate with
            experts in their fields to produce assets that represent diverse voices, perspectives, and contexts. Photos
            and videos are not edited in any way that may cause them to be false or misleading.

            We correct any factual errors in a transparent manner and strive to make it easy for our readers to bring
            errors to our attention.
